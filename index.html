        <h3>Letters to Milena</h3>
        <p class="meta">Franz Kafka and Milena Jesenka</p>
        <p class="excerpt"> My favorite genre of book is collections of real letters between real people. These letters are particularly interesting because thier affair had been entirely within these letters. Their very contrasting lives and identities kind of make this a sad but interesting read. I do wish there was more letters available from Milena's side.</p>

      <article class="post">
        <h3>We Need to Talk About Kevin</h3>
        <p class="meta">Lionel Shriver</p>
        <p class="excerpt"> Probably my favorite book when it comes to the nature vs. nurture theme. Follows the letters of a mother of a school shooter.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="post">
        <h3>Braiding Sweetgrass</h3>
        <p class="meta">Robin Wall Kimmerer</p>
        <p class="excerpt"> Although I think some of the points are debatable, the writing style is beautifully poetic.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="post">
        <h3>The Stolen White Elephant</h3>
        <p class="meta">Mark Twain</p>
        <p class="excerpt"> The only Mark Twain I've read other than parts of his autobiography. I didn't expect it to be so absurd, but this was really funny!</p>
      </article>

      <article class="post">
        <h3>What If Women Designed the City?</h3>
        <p class="meta">May East</p>
        <p class="excerpt"> Reads like a casual textbook, but gives some really interesting concepts and ideas that make cities more sustainable and friendly.</p>
      </article>
      
      <article class="post">
        <h3>The Future is Analog: How to Create a More Human World</h3>
        <p class="meta">David Sax</p>
        <p class="excerpt"> Although I don't agree with every single point the author makes, I think the book makes a really important commentary on the importance of quality physical time with one another,</p>
      </article>

      <article class="post">
        <h3>The Social Contract</h3>
        <p class="meta">Rousseau</p>
        <p class="excerpt">I've read excerpts of this book many times, so I thought I'd go ahead and read the whole thing. As expected some of the ideas (especially in the latter half) are outdated or state some false facts but overall really interesting. </p>
      </article>

      <article class="post">
        <h3>Anarchism and Other Essays</h3>
        <p class="meta">Emma Goldman</p>
        <p class="excerpt"> Emma Goldman quickly became one of my favorite writers. Except for maybe one or two essays on the events of her time, all the essays here were really interesting to think about and read.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="post">
        <h3>How to Blow Up A Pipeline</h3>
        <p class="meta">Andreas Malm</p>
        <p class="excerpt">Athough the book reads more like one big thesis, its very good at making its point. Theres a movie based on this book and I'd want to watch it.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="post">
        <h3> How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe</h3>
        <p class="meta">Charles Yu </p>
        <p class="excerpt"> I love metafiction and this book was super fun to read. It was a bit emotional at times. </p>
      </article>   

      <article class="post">
        <h3>Giovanni's Room</h3>
        <p class="meta">James Baldwin</p>
        <p class="excerpt"> One of my favorites! I think its really interesting how despite this book being written by James Baldwin, it takes place in Europe and is absent of any characters of color. Its themes mostly focus on queerness and identity. </p>
      </article>  

      <article class="post">
        <h3>I, Who Has Never Known Men</h3>
        <p class="meta">Jacqueline Harpman</p>
        <p class="excerpt">Short, but I think the point the book makes can apply outside of the female context the book uses. Really cool feminist food for thought.</p>
      </article>  
      
      <article class="post">
        <h3>Forgiving Imelda Marcos</h3>
        <p class="meta">Nathan Go</p>
        <p class="excerpt">I think it was kinda of weird to use a real-life politican for the subject of the book, but I loved the importance of the cultural/historical context when it came to the relationships between characters.</p>
      </article>    

      <article class="post">
        <h3>The Diary of Adam and Eve</h3>
        <p class="meta">Mark Twain</p>
        <p class="excerpt">This was a really funny short read. The title is very literal.</p>
      </article>
      
      <article class="post">
        <h3>A Thousand Splendid Suns</h3>
        <p class="meta">Khaled Hosseini</p>
        <p class="excerpt">Really sad, but also really good.</p>
      </article>  

      <article class="post">
        <h3>The Testaments</h3>
        <p class="meta">Margret Atwood</p>
        <p class="excerpt">Although I think as a sequel to the Handmaids Tale the plot was very influenced by the show and other adaptations, the importance and meaning of the story are still the same. Especially now more than ever, eveyrone should read the Handmaids Tale and understand where it comes from.</p>
      </article> 

      <article class="post">
        <h3>All Art is Propaganda</h3>
        <p class="meta">George Orwell</p>
        <p class="excerpt">Normally I like Orwell, but these essays were kinda boring.</p>
      </article>  

      <article class="post">
        <h3>The Athiests Mass</h3>
        <p class="meta">Honore de Balzac</p>
        <p class="excerpt">A good short story, gives a more nuanced view on having a relationship with spirituality and religon.</p>
      </article> 

      <article class="post">
        <h3>The Ones Who Stay and Fight</h3>
        <p class="meta"> N.K Jemisen </p>
        <p class="excerpt"> I think 'Those Who Walk Away from Omelas' is a really compelling story, but I think this response to it a much more nuanced and optimistic take on that moral dilemma.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="post">
        <h3>The Yellow Wallpaper</h3>
        <p class="meta"> Charlotte Perkins Gilman</p>
        <p class="excerpt"> Although it was a short story, the progression was very intense. Although it isn't a horror/thriller, it definitely kept your attention in a similar way. </p>

        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>Hi! This was a little project to get some stuff done in HTML and CSS. I normally keep my reading lists in a spreadsheet, but thought it'd be fun to switch it up! I didn't include one-off poetry I've read but any books, essays, and short stories are here. This is mostly for my reads in 2025, but the favorites page covers my all-time favorites.</p>
